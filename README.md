Pao Ying Chub Game for R

# Detail
The User can choose to use Hammer, Scissors and Paper 1 time per round. The User can play as many rounds as desired until it tells them to End game. The game then calculates the total rounds played by the player and their score. When the game ends, the total score will be displayed.

# Process
The code is designed with user input in mind, allowing for variations in typing to ensure the program still runs smoothly—even if the user types in different formats. Since R is case-sensitive, the program accounts for differences in uppercase and lowercase input.

A while loop is used to keep the game running continuously in an infinite loop, as long as the condition remains TRUE. When the player types something like "End game" (with flexibility in how it’s typed), the loop breaks and the game ends.

The program also includes score tracking features. It keeps count of both the player's and the computer's scores, records the results of each round, and displays the final scores and round history when the game is over.
